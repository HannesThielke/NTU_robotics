\section{Weekly Reports}

\subsection{Week 1: 13.08. - 17.08.}
The main focus of my work this week was to familiarize myself with the working environment and get a general overview of the project. During the first days the university account has been created, the workplace and computer have been set up and the access to the building was sorted out. I have started doing tutorials about neural networks and the robotic operation system to understand the underlying basics of my project. I then focused on reading two papers about one-shot resp. zero-shot imitation learning for robotic systems and started writing a short literature review about these. I am planning to implement one-shot imitation learning in the existing software environment for the Sawyer robotic arm in the lab.
