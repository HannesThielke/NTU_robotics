*Definition*:

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Types of Machine Learning:
<!-- drawn from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning -->
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs $$ \rightarrow $$ the "right answers" are given
<!-- drawn from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning -->
- **Unsupervised Learning**: inferring a function that describes the structure of "unlabeled" data (i.e. data that has not been classified or categorized)
<!-- drawn from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning -->
- **Reinforcement Learning**: the focus is on performance, which involves finding a balance between exploration and exploitation
- **Recommender Systems**

Problems are devided into:
- **Regression Problems**: Predict continuous valued output
- **Classification Problems**: Discrete valued output (e.g. 0 or 1)




Minimization Algorithms:
- **Gradient Descent**
- **Normal Equation**
